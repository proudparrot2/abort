# Abort
Abort is an addon to HTML sites that allows users to "Abort" from the current site and get redirected to a chosen url in less than 2 seconds.
Targeted at game sites to allow for a quick, portable panic button.

### To use Abort on your site:
Insert this code snippet at the bottom of your (html) code:
```html
<iframe src="https://abort-production.up.railway.app" style="position: fixed; cursor: pointer; bottom: 5px; right: 5px; border: none; height: 50px; width: 225px;"></iframe>
```
Google Sites do not currently work at the moment because of how they handle embedded scripts. There may be a way in the future.
